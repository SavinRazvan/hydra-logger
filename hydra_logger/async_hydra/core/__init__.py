"""
Core async components for Hydra-Logger.

This module provides the foundational async components including:
- CoroutineManager: Professional task tracking and cleanup
- EventLoopManager: Event loop safety and fallback management
- BoundedAsyncQueue: Professional async queue with backpressure
- MemoryMonitor: Memory usage monitoring and backpressure
- SafeShutdownManager: Safe shutdown protocol with data integrity
- AsyncErrorTracker: Comprehensive error tracking and monitoring
- AsyncHealthMonitor: System health monitoring and alerting
